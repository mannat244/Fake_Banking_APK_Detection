**Stopping fraud, Securing trust.**

### üßê What is FraudRakshak?

Cybercriminals often distribute fake banking apps that look identical to legitimate ones. These malicious APKs are designed to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and personal data, leading to devastating financial theft.

**FraudRakshak** is a proactive security solution that detects and flags these fraudulent applications *before* they can be installed on your device, protecting you from potential scams and securing your financial information.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Using FraudRakshak is simple and secure:

* **Upload:** You upload the APK file of the banking app you want to verify.
* **Analyze:** We perform a comprehensive two-step analysis in a secure environment.
* **Verdict:** FraudRakshak provides a clear verdict on whether the app is safe or fraudulent.

### üîí Your Privacy is Our Priority

Uploaded files are analyzed in a completely **isolated sandbox environment**. They are never shared with any third parties and are **permanently deleted** immediately after the analysis is complete to ensure your privacy and data security.

### üî¨ Our Two-Step Analysis Approach

We use a robust, dual-layered approach to ensure a thorough and accurate security assessment.

#### 1. Static Analysis

In this initial phase, we examine the APK's structure and contents without actually running the application. This allows us to identify potential threats based on the app's fundamental properties.

* **Metadata & Package Verification:** We check the package name, version, and developer information against official records.
* **Signature & Certificate Matching:** We verify the app's digital signature against the bank's known, official signature to confirm its authenticity.
* **Permission & Manifest Analysis:** We scrutinize the `AndroidManifest.xml` file for excessive or dangerous permissions that could be exploited.
* **Code & URL Inspection:** We perform a deep scan of the application's code to find hardcoded URLs, suspicious code blocks, and potential connections to malicious servers.

#### 2. Dynamic Analysis

The second phase involves running the application in a secure, sandboxed emulator to observe its behavior in real-time. This is crucial for detecting hidden malicious activities. We provide two powerful approaches for this:

* **Local Emulator Setup:** Perfect for deep, controlled analysis.
    * Download our patched APK and hook file to run on your local emulator.
    * Gain full control with root access and system-level monitoring.
    * Bypass SSL pinning to inspect encrypted traffic.
    * Closely monitor all network activity.

* **Cloud Emulator:** Perfect for quick and secure testing.
    * Instantly run the app in a secure cloud sandbox‚Äîno downloads needed.
    * Operate in a secure, isolated environment.
    * Interact in real time for a clear view of the app's behavior.

By combining these two powerful analysis techniques, FraudRakshak provides a comprehensive defense against the growing threat of fraudulent banking applications.
